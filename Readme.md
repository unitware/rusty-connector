# Rusty-connector for Linux-CNC

This is a spinoff from the Arduino conenctor project:

    https://github.com/AlexmagToast/LinuxCNC_ArduinoConnector

The implementation is not aimed to be complete.

The target for this project is the RP2040 processor and the pico-board.

I'm welcoming any suggestions on code/design/bugs etc. Pull requests welcome!

# How to..
Look at the original project for a multitude of instructions, videos et.al.
